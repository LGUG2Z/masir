_masir_ is a focus follows mouse daemon for Microsoft Windows 11 and above.

_masir_ allows you to focus an application window by moving your mouse over it, without requiring mouse clicks or
touchpad taps.

_masir_ does not have a dependency on any specific external software or tiling window manager.

_masir_ has an additional integration with [komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi) to ensure that only windows
managed by the tiling window manager are eligible to be focused. Integrations with other tiling window managers are
welcome (["Integrations"](#integrations).)

_masir_ is a free and educational source project, and one that encourages you to make charitable donations if you find
the software to be useful and have the financial means.

I encourage you to make a charitable donation to
the [Palestine Children's Relief Fund](https://pcrf1.app.neoncrm.com/forms/gaza-recovery) or contributing to
a [Gaza Funds campaign](https://gazafunds.com) before you consider sponsoring me on GitHub.

[GitHub Sponsors is enabled for this project](https://github.com/sponsors/LGUG2Z). Unfortunately I don't have anything
specific to offer besides my gratitude and shout outs at the end of _komorebi_ live development videos and tutorials.

If you would like to tip or sponsor the project but are unable to use GitHub Sponsors, you may also sponsor
through [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/lgug2z).

# Integrations

If you would like to create an integration between _masir_ and a tiling window manager, there is only one requirement:

- An updated list of window HWNDs known to and managed by the tiling window manager written to a file in a known
  location.

The path to this file of HWNDs can be passed with the `--hwnds` flag for testing purposes.

_masir_ will check for the presence of the HWND under the mouse cursor in this file when deciding if the window is
eligible to be focused.

Once testing is complete, native support for checking this file without requiring the `--hwnds` argument can be added
directly to `masir` (see `TODO: We can add checks for other window managers here`
in [`main.rs`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/masir/blob/a35754a4a29538323bf248b4491f726e366f68bd/src/main.rs#L53)).
